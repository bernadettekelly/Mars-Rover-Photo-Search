SUMMARY
My app enables users to search for images of Mars taken by one of the Mars rovers. A search can be narrowed by selecting one of three rovers, a particular camera available for the selected rover, and by entering a sol number. After submitting the search, the photos are dispayed on the page.

TECHNOLOGY USED
This app was built using HTML for structure and CSS for style. JavaScript is the programming language used, which makes this app functional by retrieving data from the NASA API, displaying the results, and submitting he form. jQuery was also utilized throughout, particularly to display and hide the appropriate cameras for the selected rover.
